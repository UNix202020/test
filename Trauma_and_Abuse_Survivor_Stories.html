    <p>                                  </p>
    <p>In America today, thousands of young adults are struggling because of past exposure to trauma and abuse. A portion of this population comes from the world of fundamentalist religion. Although most people are unaware that this is going on today, heavy-handed parental control and limited life choices are often allowed to be the norm in fundamentalist culture. Why? because fundamentalism often buries the welfare of children under the wishes and preferences of their caretakers- even when those wishes and preferences are not in the best interest of the children's development. This creates an environment, a cult-culture, where religious indoctrination is seen as more important than the child's evolution into a functioning, healthy human being. Under these circumstances, it becomes possible for a child's emotional, social, and educational needs to be neglected.</p>
    <h1>The Consequences of Fundamentalist Cult-culture</h1>
    <p2>Recent academic studies have looked at the link between childhood trauma and homelessness, and the findings have reinforced what we in the cult-culture survivor community already know: childhood trauma has dire consequences that affect people well into adulthood. People who endure unhealthy, isolated, inhibited childhoods will often struggle to survive in an adult world for which they have been ill-prepared, and are ill-equipped to navigate. This struggle presents problems of its own, including vulnerability to additional cults and further abuse from a variety of sources. Young adults who have gone through cult-culture isolation often struggle with lack of legal documentation.Just about all of them have some form of PTSD, and many are going through extreme anxiety and depression as they make theor way into this brave new world. Undiagnosed learning disabilities or stress-related medical conditions are no surprise to those familiar with young adults coming out of cult-culture, and successful treatment must be a priority. Lack of job skills and career options can create a "vicious cycle", where the survivor is trapped in a low-paying job, yet unable to find a way to attend school in order to train for a better-paying job. Survivors of cult-culture often speak about the stigma that comes with not knowing aspects of American culture- which can be a severely limiting social barrier. Additionally, if they leave their families and familiar surroundings, they often face the loss of their entire support system, making their journey truly alone, even frightening.</p2>
    <h1>The Goal of This Website</h1>
    <p3>This website is dedicated to providing a place for these young people to tell their stories in their own words, without fear of judgement. Hopefully readers will gain a better understanding of the consequences of trauma and abuse in fundamentalist cult-culture and decide that children are important enough to protect.</p3>
  <h1>The Greatest Need</h1>
    <p>Telling our stories is just the beginning of a larger project. In the future, there will be a shelter or shelter network that can provide 6-12 months of rent-free housing so that these young adults can take the time required to get supportive counseling, educational services, or begin to train for a sustainable career. Many survivors struggle because they don't have a safe place to go when things don't work out. Returning home is either impossible or not good for their mental health, but they may still be forced to go home... or live out of their cars. Many are single parents newly escaped from forced or ill-advised marriages that they undertook before they were free to make choices as informed, autonomous individuals. Young couples who marry in this culture often find themselves unhappy after a few years, so there are young single parents who need help with childcare and housing for their families.</p>
    <p>We need a shelter or shelter network, preferably run by other cult-culture survivors, that can meet these needs. The first step in building support for this project is to tell the stories of the REAL PEOPLE who are sleeping in their cars or couch surfing, or staying with parents when this is not advisable, while they try to figure out a way forward.</p>
    <h1>Please Share Our Story</h1>
    <p2>Thank you for taking the time to get to know us. Please feel free to share our stories with anyone you feel would be supportive of our project. If you would like to help us financially, there will be opportunities to do this in the near future. However our immediate goal is to raise awareness of the situations so many of us are facing.</p2>
    <h1>Volunteer With Us</h1>
    <p3>If you would like to volunteer your time and professional expertise, we could use your help. Please contact us here. We are looking for advisors who know how to start an organization and have social activism experience.<p3>
